# Write a recursive function to get the nth Fibonacci number (http://mng.bz/C29s).
# The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1. The nth number is always the sum of
# the previous twoâ€”the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5. Your definition should
# use a local tail-recursive function.

    fib(n, current, prev + current, i + 1)
  end
